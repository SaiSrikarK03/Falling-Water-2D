# Falling-Water-2D
This project features a simple falling water simulation using Pygame. Water particles are added to an 800x800 grid by clicking the mouse, where they flow and interact, simulating realistic fluid dynamics. The simulation uses randomization to create natural movement and leverages Pygame for graphics and NumPy for grid management.
